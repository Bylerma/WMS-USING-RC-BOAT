The quality of drinking water plays a crucial role in the health of animals and human beings: lakes , reservoirs, and canals are some of the major sources of drinking water.  

Water quality monitoring of these water bodies requires much effort as operators need to get in a boat with all sensors and manually check the entire lake. 

To develop a real time water monitoring system using IoT sensors and automation technology .

Monitor water quality parameters such as heavy metals, chemicals, and microbial pollutants, before water is discharged into rivers and lakes is critical.


Use Case:
This flowchart is useful in water quality monitoring systems for:
Environmental monitoring - Checking water pollution levels in lakes, rivers, or reservoirs.
Industrial water treatment - Ensuring water used in factories meets safety standards.
Drinking water supply management - Maintaining clean and safe drinking water.
Smart cities - Integrating IoT-based real-time monitoring for water quality control.
It helps in early detection of contamination, automated alerts, and data-driven decision-making for water safety management.
